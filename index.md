## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/ec-league/Keep-fit/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Rule

1. Keep time count in minute
2. Minus 20 min while not doing the exercises per day
3. Minus 20 min while not drinking enough water per day(according to  application)
4. Who get the higher score is the winner, and the person who lost the game should attribute ￥200 to the account.
5. If both of the participants keep time are below 90 min one week, they should attribute ￥200 to the account per person.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/ec-league/Keep-fit/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
